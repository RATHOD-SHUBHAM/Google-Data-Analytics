# Google-Data-Analytics

Throughout the program, I will complete several hands-on tasks and projects that are based on both everyday life and the duties of a data analyst. I'll also learn how to properly clean and organize massive volumes of data in order to prepare it for high-quality analysis along the road. Furthermore, I will gain practical experience with a variety of tools and approaches that will aid in the recognition of patterns and the discovery of correlations between data points.
